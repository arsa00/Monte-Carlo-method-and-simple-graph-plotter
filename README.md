# Monte Carlo method and simple graph plotter
This is a small piece of software that performs Monte Carlo method to calculate probability for specified task and to plot calculated probabilities on very simple 2D graph. It's created as homework project within "Probability and Statistics" class.
After running simulation for n (input) times, it has an option to plot calculated probabilities as 2D graph points and to draw theoretically calculated probability.
The task that is being simulated is: "Line segment of lenght 1 is divided at two random spots. Find probability that from obtained pieces is possible to create a triangle."
